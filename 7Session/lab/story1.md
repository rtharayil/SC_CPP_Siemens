## ‚úÖ User Story 

**Title**: Secure Initialization and Mode-Based Access for Embedded Fire Panel

**As a** system engineer,
**I want** the fire panel software to securely collect and store user and admin PINs as hashes during initial configuration,
**So that** the system enforces access control based on the mode (User/Admin) and protects sensitive data from tampering.

### üéØ Acceptance Criteria:

* During first-time setup:

  * The software prompts for a User PIN and an Admin PIN.
  * Both PINs are hashed using a secure algorithm ( bcrypt 12 rounds with salt).
  * The hashed values are stored (in memory for demo; in persistent storage in real systems).
* After initialization:

  * A console menu offers options to:

    * Log in as User
    * Log in as Admin
  * After PIN input, the entered value is hashed and compared to the stored hash.
  * On successful login, a message is shown confirming the mode.
  * On failure, access is denied.
