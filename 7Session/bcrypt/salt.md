## 🔐 What is a Salt?

A **salt** is a random value added to a password before hashing to ensure:

* The same password gives **different hashes** per user/session.
* Defends against **rainbow table attacks**.
* Increases resistance to **precomputed dictionary attacks**.

## 🔍 Structure of a bcrypt Salt

The bcrypt salt string has the following format:

```
$2b$<cost>$<22-char base64 salt>
```

Now let's analyze your example:

### `" $2b$12$1234567890123456789012 "`

| Part                     | Value                      | Meaning                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `$2b$`                   | `2b`                       | bcrypt version identifier (version `2b`)          |
| `12`                     | 12                         | Cost factor (2^12 = 4096 rounds of key expansion) |
| `1234567890123456789012` | 22-character base64 string | The **actual salt**                               |

---

## 🔢 1. Version Field (`$2a$`, `$2b$`, `$2y$`)

| Version | Meaning                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `2a`    | Original bcrypt version (can have bugs)            |
| `2b`    | ✅ Most widely supported and current version        |
| `2y`    | Used by some systems (e.g., PHP’s crypt\_blowfish) |

Use **`2b`** for new implementations.

---

## ⏱️ 2. Cost Factor (`12`)

* Determines **computational cost**.
* The number of internal hashing rounds is `2^cost`.
* Example:

  * Cost 10 → 1024 rounds
  * Cost 12 → 4096 rounds
  * Cost 14 → 16384 rounds (slower, more secure)

Higher cost = more security, but also slower. **12** is a common secure default.

---

## 🧂 3. The 22-character Salt (`1234567890123456789012`)

* Base64-encoded 16-byte (128-bit) binary string.
* Must be **exactly 22 characters**, using bcrypt's custom base64 alphabet:
  `[A-Za-z0-9./]` (no `+` or `=` like standard Base64).
* Randomly generated per password in real-world usage.

**In your example**, `1234567890123456789012` is a placeholder and should be replaced with a random value in practice.

---

## 💡 Example of a real bcrypt salt

```bash
$2b$12$Hk9kDpUUI6lj9UYbTBB3Gu
```

Here:

* `2b`: bcrypt version
* `12`: cost
* `Hk9kDpUUI6lj9UYbTBB3Gu`: random salt

---

## 🛑 Caution

Using a **hardcoded salt** like `"1234567890123456789012"` is insecure.

### ✅ Instead:

Generate salt dynamically, e.g.:

* Use `bcrypt_gensalt()` in C (OpenBSD lib)
* Use a bcrypt C++ wrapper that handles salt
* Or generate 16 secure random bytes, base64-encode them (custom alphabet), and insert into the salt string

## 📌 Summary

| Component | Example     | Meaning                    |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Version   | `$2b$`      | bcrypt version 2b          |
| Cost      | `12`        | 2^12 = 4096 hashing rounds |
| Salt      | `123456...` | Random 22-char base64 salt |

**Final format:**

```
$2b$12$<22-character-base64-salt>
```
